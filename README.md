# WBPlayer

These Classes are dedicated for DoubleClick Banner Ads for WB campaigns using ActionScript 3.

If you want your copy to easily update if there are changes, you can clone the git repository on your desktop.


Open your terminal or command prompt. Go to the directory where you want to place your copy (cloned files). Ex: (cd <PATH>)

Type in: git clone https://github.com/raf101/WBPlayer.git

Then everytime you use your copy make sure to always update your working files before you start.

Just open again your terminal or command prompt, go to your copy's directory then type:

git fetch

git merge orign/master
